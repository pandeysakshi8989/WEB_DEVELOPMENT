It's web development project code beneficial for user for e-health care with collaboration with healtheasy team. 
It is built with help of html,css,javascript,bootstrap,php and mysql. It 's my full fledged final project of my bachelor's degree. 
This mainly contains a home page with separate login for admin and user. 
Further home page allows navigate to various web pages providing some details.
 User after login send to dashboard where one can see updated schedule, took appointement accordingly and contact,feedback,and much more. Similarly once admin logged in sent to dashboard where one could see user details, update for schedule/doctor, contact, review and much more.
  For the future scope, I wanted it to collaborate to various hospitals, individuals, clinics ,medical faculty across Indian subcontinent integrating it with advanced computer technologies.
