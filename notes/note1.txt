### How to Find This Information:
If you're looking for a platform that combines all of these needs into a single location (e.g., academic reviews, accommodation listings, living costs, etc.), you might have to visit multiple websites or forums to gather comprehensive insights.

Would you like more information or a specific guide on any of these resources?

Yes, there are projects and platforms that have been built around the idea of providing comprehensive information for students about universities, including accommodation, local amenities, academic reviews, and more. While there might not be a single global project that covers *everything* in a fully integrated manner, there are a few notable **projects** and **initiatives** built around this concept. Here are some examples of student-centric projects and platforms that have been built on similar concepts:

### 1. **University Review Platforms (Student-driven Projects)**

   - **Student Room (UK)** and **Niche (US)**, which I mentioned earlier, are essentially community-driven platforms where students share reviews and insights about their university experiences, including academic life, living conditions, accommodation, and local amenities. These platforms are built on the idea of a student community providing peer-reviewed information.

   - **Campus Review Sites**: Some universities or groups of students have also developed their own review platforms, where students post their experiences regarding academics, accommodation, food, campus facilities, and more. While they may not be universal, these projects have been built by students for students and are often found on university-specific websites or local student blogs.

### 2. **"All-in-One" University Apps (Student Services Platforms)**

   A few university-specific or regional **student services apps** are built to offer a comprehensive set of services, from course reviews to accommodation bookings and local amenities. These kinds of platforms integrate a variety of features into one app or website:

   - **"CampusLife" Apps**: These apps integrate academic calendars, social groups, accommodation options, events, local services (like restaurants and tiffin centers), and sometimes even peer reviews of courses and professors. They may be built by universities or third-party developers in partnership with institutions.
   
   - **Student Union Apps**: Many universities' student unions create mobile apps or websites to centralize resources for incoming students. These often include accommodation listings, restaurant recommendations, job boards, student groups, and more. Some of these are even crowdsourced, with students adding reviews or recommendations themselves.

### 3. **International Student Assistance Projects (Non-Profit/NGO)**

   - **Edukasyon.ph (Philippines)**: This platform helps Filipino students make informed decisions about their higher education. It provides university rankings, course details, scholarship information, living costs, and reviews about different academic institutions. The project was designed to help students access critical information about both local and international universities.

   - **UniBuddy**: UniBuddy is an online platform that connects prospective students with current students at universities. It provides a real-time chat feature where prospective students can ask about accommodation, campus life, local amenities, academic programs, and more.

   - **Studyportals**: A global platform offering university comparison tools, rankings, student reviews, and more. Studyportals partners with universities to provide detailed course information, accommodation guides, and scholarship opportunities, particularly for international students. This helps prospective students make informed choices.

### 4. **Local Student Community Initiatives**

   - Some student organizations or groups develop projects to provide comprehensive local guides for their peers. These are often more niche and specific to certain universities or geographic areas but can provide very specific insights. They might include:
     - **Campus guides** with detailed maps and recommendations for places to eat, study, or hang out around the university.
     - **Accommodation listings** where students share their experiences living in different student housing complexes or apartments nearby.

### 5. **Startup Projects and Online Tools**

   - **Uniplaces**: Uniplaces is a startup that helps students find accommodation near their university, with reviews and information about different living areas, as well as price comparisons. While it started as a focus on accommodation, the platform is gradually expanding to cover other student needs, such as academic reviews and city guides for international students.

   - **Roomi**: This is an app aimed at students and young professionals looking for shared accommodation. The app allows students to find roommates and shared housing options with an emphasis on affordability and community. While not focused on academic reviews, it does offer a more integrated approach to housing and living needs for students.

### 6. **University-specific Review and Information Projects by Students**

   Some student groups or startups focus on a **niche university-specific** service. For example:
   - A group of students at a university might build a website to provide detailed reviews of specific campus facilities (libraries, dorms, dining halls, etc.), or even rate specific professors and courses. They might include links to housing resources in the local area, nearby restaurants, and living costs.
   - These platforms often grow through grassroots efforts and can become highly useful for incoming students, offering very localized insights.

### 7. **University Information Aggregators (Custom Projects)**

   Some university or city-specific information aggregators are custom-built by student groups or technology startups:

   - **University Review Websites**: These websites allow students to submit detailed reviews about universities and various aspects of university life. Students might rate professors, courses, and living conditions while also providing valuable insights into nearby amenities like restaurants, cafes, tiffin centers, etc.
   - **Open Data Projects**: Some student tech groups or developers create projects where students can contribute data on their university experience. These open-source platforms might include everything from accommodation costs to food prices, local job opportunities, and other student services.

### 8. **Crowdsourced "University Guides" Projects**

   Several students and even universities themselves create **crowdsourced guides** on various topics. These guides typically include:

   - **Living options and housing costs**
   - **City amenities and essential services** (restaurants, grocery stores, tiffin centers, cafes)
   - **Course reviews and professor ratings**
   - **Academic calendars, class schedules, and exam schedules**
   - **Social clubs and extracurricular activities**

### Summary

While there may not be one universally-recognized single project that covers all aspects of university life (accommodation, academics, living areas, local amenities, etc.) in one integrated platform, **various projects** and **student-driven initiatives** cover different facets of this idea. These include **student review platforms**, **university-specific apps**, **local guides**, **international student platforms**, and **crowdsourced databases**. 

Many of these projects are highly valuable for incoming students, especially those navigating unfamiliar territories, whether it's finding affordable housing, understanding local food options, or selecting courses. If you are thinking about developing a similar project, this space is still relatively open for new ideas, especially for a comprehensive platform that consolidates all these aspects.
